# Fake-News-Detection
A machine learning model to solve the problem of fake news circulating leading to a lot of problems in the industry.
# Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

1. Python 3.6
- This setup requires that your machine has python 3.6 installed on it. you can refer to this url https://www.python.org/downloads/ to download python. Once you have python downloaded and installed, you will need to setup PATH variables (if you want to run python program directly, detail instructions are below in how to run software section). To do that check this: https://www.pythoncentral.io/add-python-to-path-python-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command/.
- Setting up PATH variable is optional as you can also run program without it and more instructon are given below on this topic.
2. Second and easier option is to download anaconda and use its anaconda prompt to run the commands. To install anaconda check this url https://www.anaconda.com/download/
3. You will also need to download and install below 3 packages after you install either python or anaconda from the steps above
 - Sklearn (scikit-learn)
 - numpy
 - scipy

# DataSet Used
The dataset used was the one curated during 2016 presidential election in US, when fake news circulation was a big problem.
